      <h1>About PuddingApp</h1>
      <p>Pudding App was created to celebrate anniversary of one very special year.</p>
      <p>Whole application is designed and made by Ruby On Rails developer Vedran MijatoviÄ‡ as his first independent project. I think it is important to emphasize that PuddingApp doesen't contain any pictures and all its art is made exclusively with written code.</p>
      <p>It is not finished and new patches will be released as well as new features on which you will be noticed through application.</p>
      <p>If you notice some bugs or errors during your stay here, please, feel free to notify your personal developer xD</p>
